The alias is an amino acid name indexed from the start of each nsp in Orf1ab, as opposed to from the start of the gene as is the default.	Use HGVS syntax; p. (protein) mutations should be included here; use 3 letter code preferred for amino acids.	YP_009724390.1:p.Cys300Ser					
VIRUSMVP_SARS-CoV-2	Mutation position information	OBI:0002878	gene name	gene name	gene name menu				TRUE						The name of a gene, (typically) assigned by a person and/or according to a naming scheme. It may contain white space characters and is typically more intuitive and readable than a gene symbol. It (typically) may be used to identify similar genes in different species and to derive a gene symbol.	The long name for the gene/protein. Gene names or gene product names are acceptable.  SARS-CoV-2 gene names are from GENEPIO.	Spike gene (SARS-CoV-2)					
VIRUSMVP_SARS-CoV-2	Mutation position information	OBI:0002877	gene symbol	gene symbol	string				TRUE						The short name of a gene; a single word that does not contain white space characters.
